The first "thing" I ever coded

During middle school, I had obtained my first PC.  I spent a lot of my free time playing various flash games on the internet.
One of the genres of games I played often were known as "falling sand" games.  In my quest to find other types and styles of these
kinds of games, I ran across the "Enigma Sand" a sort of sandbox for creating your own game.  

This intrigued me greatly, but I found out I had to learn how to code.  And I had never seen any kind of code before,
so all of it appeared very foreign, but after a lot of head banging, I eventually figured some things out.

I did not create the EnigmaSand4-bin.jar file, but all the *.XML files are created by me, each one being a certain revision.
My version control, as well as naming convention was non existent, so if I wanted to test something really new, I would
create a copy of the file, try to implement it, and test.  So I would have several of the same file all with different methods
of trying to add in something new, eventually just carrying on with whatever revision/copy of the file that actually worked.

At this point, the only file that works is the "Copy of Standard.xml" and has collected dust after being untouched for several years.
However, I did include all the older, and non-working versions of the *.XML files simply for viewing purposes.

In order to actually PLAY the game, start the "EnigmaSand4-bin.jar" file.  
In the bottom left hand corner, click File -> Load Mod.  Then, select the "Copy of Standard.xml" file.  Everything should load,
and you should be presented with a selection of various "sands"

The purpose of the game is to simply play with the various sands and things within the game, 
I suppose it's like some kind of zen garden, but with the potential of adding in whatever you can come up with.
